It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

TASKS:

1)	Out of all the 30 independent input variables, find the variables that are most useful in predicting ‘Class’.
2)	Try implementing PCA (whether it is useful or not) to reduce no. of independent variables.
3)	Draft the following classification models to predict ‘Class’: Logistic regression, SVC, Decision Tree Classifier. Write a detailed explanation of each of the models.
