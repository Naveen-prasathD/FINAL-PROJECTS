Absenteeism at Work Prediction:

This enormous HR data set focuses on employee absence. It contains a staggering 8335 rows and 13 columns of data.
The data set contains employee numbers and names, gender, city, job title, department, store location, business unit, division, age, length of service, and the number of hours absent.

Create ML models to predict the ‘No. of hours absent’ with minimum MSE and RMSE and maximum R-Square score. 
Build the following models:

      1.	Multiple Linear Regressor (MLR)
      2.	Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
      3.	MLR with PCA
      4.	RFR with PCA
      
Write an inference on the models you prepared.
